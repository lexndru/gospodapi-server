# gospodapi
Gospodapi is a server-side application to build and maintain general ledgers. The name is a wordplay between "gospodÄƒrie" (ro) meaning household and "API" (en abbr).

# Known issues and limits of the implementation
- No pagination: this may cause problems to clients which cannot support long (as in time) bigger (as in size) tranfeser of data;
- No standard errors: although it's covered in tests, there may be unexpected use-cases for a client to encounter as a direct Golang error in plain text on a 5xx status code response;
- The "cache feature" is always on: there's no option to disable cache for reading/listing with GET verbs;
- Golang ioutil: some modules (e.g. registry, insights) use a memory intensive module which may cause DOS on some systems;
- Upserting transactions by UUID with detailed breakdown of the amount will cause data corruption;

# Todo
- [ ] Save process state while gracefullly shutting down with close() method

- [ ] Benchmark API request against PostgreSQL/MariaDB/MySQL/SQLite
- [x] Add ON UPDATE CASCADE for actors and labels name changes
